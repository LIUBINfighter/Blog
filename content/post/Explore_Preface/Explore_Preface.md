### Preface

I believe that every new SUSTecher has experienced some level of confusion about how to navigate college life. Even during the summer vacation, many still worry about missing any lecture or opportunity provided by SUSTech.

Unlike that in our past 12 years only for education, we now need to shift our mindset from doing what others deem right to pursuing what we believe is right, while courageously investing our energy and taking on responsibility. Mastering the art of directing your attention, and using that to gain insights into your surroundings and yourself, will be among the most crucial tasks you face.

This is a condensed and revised version of my speech from the summer gathering in Sichuan and the Yueqi live broadcast, intended to offer some help to everyone. There will be a series of articles offering guidance from various perspectives.

Obviously, no single article can solve everyone's lifelong challenges once for good. However, as we each strive for our own goals, we also open up new possibilities for others to consider.

### 前言

我想新南科人都或多或少地迷惘过自己应当如何面对大学生活，即使在暑假也担惊受怕，放不下错过的某一场讲座。

和前12年的教育经历不同的是，我们的心态要从**做大家认为正确的事**，转变为**做自己认为正确的事**，并且勇敢地投入精力和承担责任。正确控制自己注意力的投射，并以此为基础，理解环境和自己，将会是最重要的课题之一。

这是我在暑假川聚线下活动和南科一家亲-悦启直播中演讲内容的精简再创作，希望能帮助到大家。将会有一系列文章陆续更新，从不同侧面为大家提供参考。

虽然没有哪篇文章能一劳永逸地解决大家的人生问题，不过每个人在为自己拼搏的同时，也提供给了他人不同可能性的思考。
