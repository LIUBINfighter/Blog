### Preface

I believe that every new SUSTecher has experienced some level of confusion about how to navigate college life. Even during the summer vacation, many still worry about missing any lecture or opportunity provided by SUSTech.

我想新南科人都都或多或少地迷惘过自己应当如何面对大学生活，即使在暑假也担惊受怕，放不下错过一场讲座。

Unlike our previous 12 years of education, we now need to shift our mindset from doing what others deem right to pursuing what we believe is right, while courageously investing our energy and taking on responsibility.

和前12年的教育经历不同的是，我们的心态要从做大家认为正确的事，转变为做自己认为正确的事，并且勇敢地投入精力和承担责任。

This is a condensed and revised version of my speech from the summer gathering in Sichuan and the Yueqi live broadcast, intended to offer some help to everyone. There will be a series of articles offering guidance from various perspectives.

这是我在暑假川聚线下活动和南科一家亲-悦启直播中演讲内容的精简再创作，希望能帮助到大家。陆续将会有一系列文章分不同侧面为大家提供参考。

Obviously, no single article can solve everyone's lifelong challenges. However, as we each strive for our own goals, we also open up new possibilities for others to consider.

虽然没有哪篇文章能一劳永逸地解决大家的人生问题，每个人在为自己拼搏的同时，也提供给他人不同可能性的思考。

Per Aspera, Ad Astra.

颠簸路途通繁星。
