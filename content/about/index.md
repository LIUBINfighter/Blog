## Who am I

Hi, I'm Huajie Liu (刘华杰), a full-time, second-year undergraduate at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/), majoring in Big Data Management and Applications.

I have a keen interest in **New Classical Macroeconomics**, **Complexity Science** and crypto trading, but I'm still exploring where I truly belong in my first year in SUSTech.

I have informally worked as a C/C++ developer for [ARTINX](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/YfFsbup3Vw61xo0SRzQpZw), a lab focused on the [ROBOMASTER](https://www.robomaster.com/zh-CN) competition, from Oct 2023 to Apr 2024. I am very grateful for the opportunity and support they provided.

Currently, I am a part-time intern at [PoliAI](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkyOTY0MjUwOQ==&mid=2247483713&idx=1&sn=fd5d782562a0d85c83debb5a6ee7ef69&chksm=c33f600868bf845ed3c61e2cce88c3fd5ca64bddc38ef34d599cf8420d4ab9348b61dab2ad91&mpshare=1&scene=23&srcid=09028BlZGnW8RciGs4wMnNQV&sharer_shareinfo=d4bf94603d9d468381931768fdf80932&sharer_shareinfo_first=d4bf94603d9d468381931768fdf80932#rd), a startup focused on big data management, AI-powered policy consulting and applications. We are hiring now, and I am looking forward to explore the world and engage in potential collaboration opportunities with you all!

### Nicknames

In formal situation, I go by the name Huajie Liu or LIU Huajie.

After starting my project about [survival_manual](https://liubinfighter.github.io/Jay_Survival_Manual/#/), I also use Jay Bridge as my English name.

In other cases, you can find me by Bin Liu, LIUBIN, 星(Star) or LIUBINfighter. But Jay Bridge is now my most frequently used name anyway!

### My friends

I am waiting for their personal websites...

and yours!

## About the Blog

On this blog, I will share my academic journey, investment insights, and entrepreneurial experiences, and I look forward to growing together with you all.

Feel free to reach out to me.

Related links:[Jay_Survival_Manual](https://liubinfighter.github.io/Jay_Survival_Manual/#/)

You can find more information about my articles and projects.

<!-- This structure of e-book is better suited for serializing the writing of various articles. -->

### Articles

TBD.

(Updated on Oct 12,2024) I find it's not easy to write and upload articles even once a week...

And the blog is less well-organized than an e-book. Therefore, for consecutive serialized articles or thematic articles, I will organize them in the [SurvivingManual](https://liubinfighter.github.io/Jay_Survival_Manual/#/).

Still, I can write some blogs whose content is relatively independent to one another here.

### Courses

#### 2024 Fall

- MIS310 Social Network Models and Applications

- EBA203 Management Information System

- English for Academic Purposes

### English

Mastering the language of the world allows us to engage with outstanding people and events all over the globe.

For most of my articles, I will try to biuld a constant English corner.

### New Classical Macroeconomics

I hope to gain a deeper understanding of the world's economic development through Xiaokai Yang's New Classical Economics theory.

### Complexity Science

Complexity Science will transform the way we think. There's no reason to pass up such an opportunity.

### Crypto

By focusing on hedging and order book analysis, new opportunities can be identified.

I will share my tools and stratges, and help you understand why orderbook works.
