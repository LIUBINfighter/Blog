## Who am I

Hi, I'm Huajie Liu (刘华杰), a full-time, second-year undergraduate at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/), majoring in Big Data Management and Applications.

I have informally worked as a C/C++ developer for [ARTINX](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/YfFsbup3Vw61xo0SRzQpZw), a lab focused on the [ROBOMASTER](https://www.robomaster.com/zh-CN) competition, from Oct 2023 to Apr 2024. I am very grateful for the opportunity and support they provided.

Currently, I am a part-time intern at [PoliAI](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkyOTY0MjUwOQ==&mid=2247483713&idx=1&sn=fd5d782562a0d85c83debb5a6ee7ef69&chksm=c33f600868bf845ed3c61e2cce88c3fd5ca64bddc38ef34d599cf8420d4ab9348b61dab2ad91&mpshare=1&scene=23&srcid=09028BlZGnW8RciGs4wMnNQV&sharer_shareinfo=d4bf94603d9d468381931768fdf80932&sharer_shareinfo_first=d4bf94603d9d468381931768fdf80932#rd), a startup focused on big data management, AI-powered policy consulting and applications. We are hiring now, and I am looking forward to explore the world and engage in potential collaboration opportunities with you all!
