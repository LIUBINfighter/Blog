## Who am I

Hi, I'm Huajie Liu (刘华杰), a full-time undergraduate at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/), majoring in Big Data Management and Applications.

I have a keen interest in **New Classical Macroeconomics**, **Complexity Science** and crypto trading, but I'm still exploring where I truly belong in my first year in SUSTech.

I have informally worked as a C/C++ developer for [ARTINX](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/YfFsbup3Vw61xo0SRzQpZw), a lab focused on the [ROBOMASTER](https://www.robomaster.com/zh-CN) competition, from Oct 2023 to Apr 2024. I am very grateful for the opportunity and support they provided.

### Nicknames

In formal situation, I go by the name Huajie Liu or LIU Huajie.

In other cases, you can find me by Bin Liu, LIUBIN, 星(Star) or LIUBINfighter.

### My friends

I am waiting for their personal websites...

and yours!
